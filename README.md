# blocklists

This is a personal repository listing the Pihole configurations I'm currently using. It's sole pourpose it's to re-configure it in case I lose the or mess up my pihole.

testblocklist.txt is a file used to block te domain temporarily and see if everything is still working fine. Domains usually stay there for a couple of days before getting pushed to the actuall list it's suposed to be. 

default is the main list that is going to be applied to all users network-wide

Other device specific lists might also be created.
